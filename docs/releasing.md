# Releasing gotreesitter

## Cadence

Planned minor releases are cut on Thursdays in `America/Los_Angeles`. A
Thursday without a coherent, green release is skipped; the schedule is a
batching boundary, not a reason to ship unfinished work.

Planned releases require a 48-hour soak after the exact commit completes the
hosted continuous integration (CI) workflow in `ci.yml`. Keep this conservative
rule until the project reviews a risk classifier.

The one-time `owner-waived-minor` route applies only to v0.48.0. It waives the
Thursday and soak rules. It requires an owner waiver reason, an incident, and a
delay rationale. Remove the route after the v0.48.0 tag exists.

Patch releases may happen outside the cadence for urgent correctness,
security, or packaging regressions. Ordinary maintenance waits for the next
Thursday. Release planning and in-progress campaign notes live in the private
`hypha://m31labs/gotreesitter` space rather than a public release-train issue.

v0.47.0 is the final planned off-cadence minor. The first cadence release is
the next eligible Thursday after v0.47.0.

## Release checklist

1. Freeze a coherent scope. Merge its pull requests and clear the pull-request
   queue; do not release from a feature branch.
2. Move the accumulated changelog entries from `Unreleased` into a dated
   version section. Update the comparison links and the README release status.
3. Dispatch the full hosted `ci.yml` workflow for the exact commit on `main`.
   Require its successful completion. Keep correctness, parity, race, and
   performance evidence distinct.
4. Wait at least 48 hours after hosted CI completes for a planned minor
   release. Record the actual soak for an urgent patch.
5. Dispatch the manual `release.yml` workflow from `main`. Supply the version,
   candidate commit hash, release route, and signed Hyphae receipt ID.
6. For an urgent patch, also supply the incident and explain why waiting is
   worse. Do not use this route for ordinary maintenance.
7. For the v0.48.0 waiver, supply an owner reason, incident, and delay rationale.
   This route waives only the Thursday and soak rules.
8. Review the verification evidence. Approve the protected `release`
   environment only when Arbiter selects `Allow`.
9. Let the workflow repeat the mutable checks. Arbiter reevaluates the
   resulting facts before the workflow creates the tag and GitHub release.
10. Verify that the module proxy can fetch the new version.
11. Checkpoint the version, commit hash, gate results, and any intentionally
   deferred work in Hyphae. Close campaign issues only when the release
   contains their documented acceptance evidence.

Tags are immutable. If a release is wrong, preserve its tag and publish a
follow-up version.

Keep the `receipt_uri` input name for workflow dispatch compatibility. Supply a
signed Hyphae receipt ID, not a `hypha://` URI. Use
`hypha-receipt:YYYY-MM-DD:<short-id>`.

The workflow has no schedule. The Go evidence collector writes deterministic
facts to `policy-facts.json`. It does not choose the release route.

The `policy/release.arb` strategy is the authoritative publication decision.
It selects exactly one `Allow` or `Deny` outcome. The workflow installs Arbiter
v1.9.0 from its digest-pinned release archive.

The strategy denies a release when a fact does not satisfy the release receipt.
These facts include:

- the weekday;
- the one-time waiver route and its required reasons;
- the current `main` commit;
- the exact manual CI run, result, and soak;
- the document state;
- the tag and release state;
- the GitHub service result.

The evidence artifacts record the CI run ID, URL, event, commit, conclusion,
and completion time.

## External activation gates

Keep the release workflow inactive until repository owners confirm these
controls:

- Create the protected `release` environment.
- Require one owner reviewer for that environment.
- Restrict that environment to `main`.
- Set the default workflow permission to read-only.
- Add a `v*` tag ruleset before publication.
- Block tag updates and deletions.
- Restrict tag creation to the governed release workflow when GitHub supports
  that actor rule.

Treat an unsupported tag actor rule as an external blocker. Do not weaken the
local workflow to compensate for it.
